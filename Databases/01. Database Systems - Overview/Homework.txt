1. What database models do you know?

    - Hierarchical model
    - Hierarchical key-value model
    - Network model
    - Relational (table) model
    - Object model
    - Document model
    - Associative (Key-value) model
    - Entity–relationship model
    - etc ...

2. Which are the main functions performed by a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)

    - Database management system is designed to manage a database.
    - RDBMS Systems are very mature, rock solid.

    -> Popular RDBMS Servers: 
        - Microsoft SQL Server
        - Microsoft Access
        - Oracle MySQL
        - Database
        - IBM DB2
        - PostgreSQL (Open-sourse cloning of Oracle)
        - SQLite (.dll - Database Server / .db - DB data)
        - Sybase ASE

    - Using for management of relational data stored in tables.

    - Definition of relational schema (database schema).

    - Creating, modifying, deleting tables and relationships between them.

    - Adding, modifying, deleting, searching and retrieving data stored in tables.

    - SQL Language Support.

    - Management (maintenance) of transactions.

3. Define what is "table" in database terms.

    - Table represents the structure the data will be stored. Table stores information organized in rows and columns.

    - Row represents information about one record.
    - Column represents a piece information / characteristic about certain record. Column has name and type.

    -> Schema of table (example):
        Persons (
            Id: number,
            FirstName: string,
            LastName: string,
            Employer: string
        )

4. Explain the difference between a primary and a foreign key.

    - Primary key (Composite primary key) is a column(s) of the table that uniquely identifies the rows (records). Primary key is unique - meets only one time in certain column. 

    - The purpose of Foreign key is to avoid data duplicates in table columns. The repeating data is separate in new table as each record has primary key used in the master table. Foreign key is not unique - can be used many times in certain column (usually number instead strings e.g.).

5. Explain the different kinds of relationships between tables in relational databases.

    - One-to-many – e.g. country -> towns (Many towns in one country)
    
    - Many-to-many – e.g. students <-> courses (Many students in many courses and conversely) - Implemented through additional table

    - One-to-one – e.g. example human <- student (Using Inheritance)

    - Self-relationship - e.g. 1. Root <- 2. Documents (ParentId: 1) <- 3. Pictures (1) <- 4. Birthday Party (3)

6. When is a certain database schema normalized? What are the advantages of normalized databases?

    - Normalization removes repating data from certain column or group of columns. 

    - Separate repeating values from certain column to a new table (Master table) and replace old repating values to Details table with their Primary keys from the Master table.

    - Avoing data duplication using unique data identifier (Primary key - usually number) from the new table (Master table).

7. What are database integrity constraints and when are they used?

    - Ensure data integrity in the database tables    
    - Enforce data rules whick cannot be violated

    -> Used for Primary key:
        - Ensures unique value for each table row

    -> Used for Unique key:
        - Ensures that all values in a certain column are unique

    -> Used for Foreign key:
        - Ensures that the value in given column is a key from another table

    -> Used for Check constraint (data restriction):
        - Ensures that values in a certain column meet some predefined condition

8. Point out the pros and cons of using indexes in a database.

    -> Pros:
        - Faster lookup for results in certain column or group of columns (using index structures such as B-Trees or Hash Indexes to speed up searching of values). 
        - Instead of scanning the entire table for the results.

    -> Cons: 
        - Slower writes - adding / deleting records in indexed tables is slower.
        - May cause the system to restructure the index of structure (Hash Index, B-Tree, etc), which can be very computationally expensive.
        - Takes up more disk space - stores more data.

9. What's the main purpose of the SQL language?

    -> DDL - Data Definition Language: 
        - Creating, altering, deleting tables and other objects in the database.

    -> DML - Data Manipulation Language:
        - Searching, retrieving, inserting, modifying and deleting table data (rows).

10. What are transactions used for? Give an example.

    - Used of competitive data access.
    - Sequence of operations executing as a single unit.
    - Can be rolled back if they are not completed properly.

11. What is a NoSQL database?
    
    - Use document-based model (non-relational)
    - Data stored as documents
    - Single entity (document) is a single record
    - Documents do not have a fixed structure

12. Explain the classical non-relational data models.

    - A non-relational database is a database that does not incorporate the table/key model that relational database management systems (RDBMS) promote.

    -  These kinds of databases require data manipulation techniques and processes designed to provide solutions to big data problems that big companies face. 

    - The most popular emerging non-relational database is called NoSQL (Not Only SQL).

13. Give few examples of NoSQL databases and their pros and cons.

    -> Databases:
        - Cassandra (Distributed wide-column database)
        - MongoDB (Mature and powerful JSON-Document database)
        - CouchDB (JSON-based document database with REST API)
        - Redis (Ultra-fast in-memory data structures server)
        - H-Base
        - etc ...

    -> Models: 
        - Document model
        - Associative (Key-value) model
        - Hierarchical key-value model
        - Wide-column model
        - Object model
        - etc ...

    -> Pros: 
        - Support CRUD operations
        - Support Indexing and querying
        - Support concurrency and transactions
        - Highly optimized for append / retrieve
        - Great performance and scalability
        - etc ...

    -> Cons:
        - Difficult administration and support
        - etc ...

## XML Basics

1. What does the XML language represents? What does it used for? 
2. Create XML document students.xml, which contains structured description of students. For each student you should enter information for his name, sex, birth date, phone, email, course, specialty, faculty number and a list of taken exams (exam name, tutor, score).
3. What does the namespaces represents in the XML documents? What are they used for? 
4. Explore http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Uniform_Resource_Identifier to learn more about URI, URN and URL definitions.
5. Add default namespace for the students "urn:students".
6. Create XSD Schema for the students.xml document. Add new elements in the schema: information for enrollment (date and exam score) and teacher's endorsements.
7. Write a XSL stylesheet to visualize the students as HTML. Test it in your favourite browser.

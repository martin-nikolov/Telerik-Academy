1. Take the VS solution **"Abstraction"** and refactor its code to provide good abstraction. Move the properties and methods from the class `Figure` to their correct place. Move the common methods to the base class's interface. Remove all duplicated code (properties / methods / other code).
* Establish good encapsulation in the classes from the VS solution **"Abstraction"**. Ensure that incorrect values cannot be assigned in the internal state of the classes.
* Take the VS solution **"Cohesion-and-Coupling"** and refactor its code to follow the principles of good abstraction, loose coupling and strong cohesion. Split the class `Utils` to other classes that have strong cohesion and are loosely coupled internally.
* Redesign the classes and refactor the code from the solution **"Inheritance-and-Polymorphism"** to follow the best practices in high-quality classes. Extract abstract base class and move all common properties in it. Encapsulate the fields and make sure required fields are not left without a value. Reuse the repeating code though base methods.

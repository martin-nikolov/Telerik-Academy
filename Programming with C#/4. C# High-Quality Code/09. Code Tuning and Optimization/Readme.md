## Code Tuning and Optimization

1. You are given a C# application "[homework.zip](https://github.com/flextry/Telerik-Academy/blob/master/Programming%20with%20C%23/4.%20C%23%20High-Quality%20Code/09.%20Code%20Tuning%20and%20Optimization/09.%20Code%20Tuning%20and%20Optimization.zip)" which displays an animated 3D model of the Solar system.
  * Use a profiler to find the places in its source code which cause significant performance degradation (**bottlenecks**).
        * Provide a **screenshot** of the profiler's result and indicate the place in the source code where the bottleneck resides (name of the file, line of code).
    * Make a **quick fix** in the source code in order to significantly improve the performance. **Test the code** after the fix for correctness + performance.
* Write a program to compare the performance of **add, subtract, increment, multiply, divide** for `int`, `long`, `float`, `double` and `decimal` values.
* Write a program to compare the performance of **square root, natural logarithm, sinus** for `float`, `double` and `decimal` values.
* \* Write a program to compare the performance of **insertion sort, selection sort, quicksort** for `int`, `double` and `string` values. Check also the following cases: random values, sorted values, values sorted in reversed order.

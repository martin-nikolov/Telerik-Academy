## Unit Testing

1. Write three classes: `Student`, `Course` and `School`. Students should have name and unique number (inside the entire School). Name can not be empty and the unique number is between 10000 and 99999. Each course contains a set of students. Students in a course should be less than 30 and can join and leave courses.
* Write VSTT tests for these two classes
    * Use 2 class library projects in Visual Studio: `School.csproj` and `TestSchool.csproj`
* Execute the tests using Visual Studio and check the code coverage. Ensure it is at least 90%.

## Advanced Data Structures

1. Implement a class `PriorityQueue<T>` based on the data structure "binary heap".
* Write a program to read a large collection of products (name + price) and efficiently find the first 20 products in the price range [a...b]. Test for 500 000 products and 10 000 price searches.
    * Hint: you may use `OrderedBag<T>` and sub-ranges.
* Write a program that finds a set of words (e.g. 1000 words) in a large text (e.g. 100 MB text file). Print how many times each word occurs in the text.
    * Hint: you may find a C# `trie` in Internet.

* You are given a cable TV company. The company needs to lay cable to a new neighborhood (for every house). If it is constrained to bury the cable only along certain paths, then there would be a graph representing which points are connected by those paths. But the cost of some of the paths is more expensive because they are longer. If every house is a node and every path from house to house is an edge, find a way to minimize the cost for cables.

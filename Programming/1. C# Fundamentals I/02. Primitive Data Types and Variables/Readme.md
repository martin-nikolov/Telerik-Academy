## Primitive Data Types and Variables

1. Declare five variables choosing for each of them the most appropriate of the types `byte`, `sbyte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long`, `ulong` to represent the following values: 52130, -115, 4825932, 97, -10000.
* Which of the following values can be assigned to a variable of type `float` and which to a variable of type `double`: 34.567839023, 12.345, 8923.1234857, 3456.091?
* Write a program that safely compares floating-point numbers with precision of **0.000001**. Example: (5.3 ; 6.01) -> false; (5.00000001 ; 5.00000003) -> true
* Declare an integer variable and assign it with the value **254** in hexadecimal format. Use Windows Calculator to find its hexadecimal representation.
* Declare a character variable and assign it with the symbol that has Unicode code **72**. Hint: first use the Windows Calculator to find the hexadecimal representation of 72.
* Declare a boolean variable called `isFemale` and assign an appropriate value corresponding to your gender.
* Declare two string variables and assign them with **"Hello"** and **"World"**. Declare an `object` variable and assign it with the concatenation of the first two variables (mind adding an interval). Declare a third `string` variable and initialize it with the value of the object variable (you should perform type casting).
* Declare two string variables and assign them with following value:

    > The "use" of quotations causes difficulties.

    Do the above in two different ways: with and without using quoted strings.
* Write a program that prints an isosceles triangle of 9 copyright symbols `©`. Use Windows Character Map to find the Unicode code of the `©` symbol. Note: the `©` symbol may be displayed incorrectly.
* A marketing firm wants to keep record of its employees. Each record would have the following characteristics – first name, family name, age, gender (m or f), ID number, unique employee number (27560000 to 27569999). Declare the variables needed to keep the information for a single employee using appropriate data types and descriptive names.
* Declare two integer variables and assign them with **5** and **10** and after that exchange their values.
* Find online more information about **ASCII** (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and write a program that prints the entire ASCII table of characters on the console.
* Create a program that assigns `null` values to an integer and to double variables. Try to print them on the console, try to add some values or the null literal to them and see the result.
* A bank account has a holder name (first name, middle name and last name), available amount of money (balance), bank name, IBAN, BIC code and 3 credit card numbers associated with the account. Declare the variables needed to keep the information for a single bank account using the appropriate data types and descriptive names.

## Operators and Expressions

1. Write an expression that checks if given integer is odd or even.
2. Write a boolean expression that checks for given integer if it can be divided (without remainder) by **7** and **5** in the same time.
3. Write an expression that calculates rectangle's area by given `width` and `height`.
4. Write an expression that checks for given integer if its third digit (right-to-left) is **7**.

    **Example:** 1732 -> true.

5. Write a boolean expression for finding if the bit **3** (counting from 0) of a given integer is 1 or 0.
6. Write an expression that checks if given point (`x`, `y`) is within a circle **K((0, 0), 5)**.
7. Write an expression that checks if given positive integer `n` (n ≤ 100) is prime.

    **Example:** 37 is prime.

8. Write an expression that calculates trapezoid's area by given sides `a` and `b` and height `h`.
9. Write an expression that checks for given point (`x`, `y`) if it is within the circle **K((1,1), 3)** and out of the rectangle **R(top=1, left=-1, width=6, height=2)**.

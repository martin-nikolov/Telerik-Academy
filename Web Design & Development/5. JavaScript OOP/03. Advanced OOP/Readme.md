Implement a repository to keep students and teachers in schools

1. Implement the schools repository using Prototypal OOP
* Implement the schools repository using Classical OOP
* Implement a image slider control using Prototypal OOP
    * The slider has a set of images and only one can be enlarged
    * Each image in the image slider has a title and two urls (thumbnail url and large image url)
    * When an image from the thumbnails is clicked
    * The slider must have buttons for prev/next image
* Create a favorite sites bar
    * The favorite sites bar should keep a set of urls and set of folders
    * Folders have a title and set of urls
    * Urls have a title and a url
    * The favorite sites bar should have a functionality to display urls and folders
    * If an url is clicked, it should be open in new tab in the browser
    * Use Classical OOP with `Class.create()`
